"I had the chance to first network with Shawna when I was interning at Avanade, and she took me on as a mentee when I joined full-time. Shawna synced with me weekly to help give me guidance on how to succeed in consulting and tech. She created an approachable and open environment where I can freely ask questions I have and she can offer helpful advice. With Shawna's help, I have taken major leaps in planning out and advancing my career, understanding the opportunities I have as a consultant, and growing my network." - Abhinav Chandra (Avanade San Diego AI & Automation Practice Analyst)

"Shawna was very enthusiastic and ready to jump right in to help gather and leverage data to prepare for upcoming migration waves. Her insight and knowledge was greatly appreciated." - Stacey Banks (Technical Program Manager at Amazon)

"Over the past four years, Shawna has been an outstanding partner to the UCI ICS Capstone Projects, consistently delivering impactful projects that connect academic and industry needs. In her role as a Data Science lead with Accenture, Shawna has gone above and beyond, mentoring our students and driving them to tackle real-world challenges with advanced AI solutions. Her leadership shines in fostering a collaborative environment where students feel empowered to contribute their unique strengths, resulting in solutions that not only address client needs but also drive tangible business outcomes.

Shawna's dedication to academic rigor has led her teams to publish their research across respected platforms, including UROP, NSF, and WJARR, adding a meaningful layer of scholarly achievement to the capstone experience. Her combination of technical expertise, hands-on guidance, and motivational leadership has made a significant and lasting impact on our UCI ICS students and the field of data science. I highly recommend Shawna for her visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to advancing innovation through collaboration." - Mimi Anderson (UCI ICS Capstone Projects Associate Director)

"I had the pleasure of having Shawna as my manager for Accenture DSSG's pro-bono work with United Way Bay Area. From the start, Shawna's approachability and technical expertise stood out to me, helping our team tackle difficult statistical analyses coupled with complex historical data. She is also a gifted communicator - she explained technical concepts to non-technical client stakeholders in an accessible way and was a strong mentor to our team of junior data scientists and analysts. As a result, we successfully concluded the second phase of analysis with UWBA and have continued the partnership for a third phase of work.

Shawna excelled both as a data science expert and a strong people-focused manager. She played a crucial role in the success of Accenture's pro-bono partnership with UWBA. I was honored to have this opportunity to work with Shawna." - Vivian Du (Accenture San Francisco Tech Architecture Analyst)

"I know we haven't gotten a chance to work closely together this year but my previous interactions with you leave me with not doubt that you'll be a high performer at the Manager level.

David - happy to chat as needed. Tuli has been terrific on the UCI engagement, brings strong organizational skills along with the type of attitude that makes others want to work with her." - Manish Dasaur (Accenture Los Angeles Managing Director)

"I am delighted to commend the exceptional work of Shawna Tuli who lead the data analytics project for our SparkPoint program, which provides free financial coaching services for low-income families throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Shawna led the team successfully through complex data analytics that addressed critical questions we had about the effectiveness of the program model. We provided Shawna and her team with 15 years worth of historical data to help identify trends and actionable insights to inform future program decisions as we scale the program out to the rest of the State of California. Her dedication and expertise have been instrumental in evaluating the impact of our SparkPoint program. By meticulously guiding a team of analysts, Shawna provided invaluable insights into various aspects of our program model, shedding light on areas that can inform our future strategy and program refinement. Her leadership, analytical acumen, and collaborative spirit have not only enhanced our understanding of SparkPointâ€™s effectiveness but also set a high standard for future projects. We are deeply grateful for her remarkable contributions and the positive impact she has made on our organization." - Jacqueline Chan (United Way Bay Area Vice President, Impact Strategies)

#### "Office / Recruiting 
Once again, Shawna was the mainstay of our UC Irinve (UCI) recruiting efforts. She participated in an all-day recruiting fair on campus. She spoke with so many people that by the end of the day she lost her voice. She also led our Capstone Program, where a few Accenture people team with UCI grad students in a case competition, focusing on Data, Analytics, and AI. She completed the Marketing activities to reach the students and played a major role working with the team. This year the team utilized LLMs to enhance customer service within the call center (see attached document for more details). I stress this work because this is not easy, and she does it as a "Plus 1." The result for us is improved brand on campus and with our target professors and access to some of UCI's top students. 

#### Office / Stewardship
Shawna has helped me several times with people related tasks. For example, a highly ranked grad student from Yale approached me about finding out more about Accenture and the opportunities here (a family friend's son). He was very impressive and had an undergraduate degree in Data Science from UC Berkeley so I immediately thought that Shawna would be a great person to talk with him about what it is like working in the field at Accenture. She eagerly agreed to meet with him, followed through very quickly and the feedback from the student was that it was the best conversation he has ever had about Accenture. Shawna has also completed multiple research papers that were published - truly amazing and detailed work. These are just two examples of how she is a true steward of our people and overall brand. 

Shawna does so many things and does them all in a worldclass way that I am certain she must have a twin sister - as I have no idea where she finds the time." - Marty Hodgett (Accenture Southern California Office Managing Director) 

#### "Outstanding Leadership and Contribution: Shawna's Exceptional Efforts in UC Irvine Capstone Program
I am delighted to recognize Shawna's extraordinary contributions as the +1 leader in our engagement with the UC Irvine Capstone Program. Over the past three years, Shawna has demonstrated exceptional leadership, driving the program's success and fostering a valuable partnership between Accenture and the university. 

#### Innovative Approach and Technical Expertise
Shawna has worked closely with Accenture AI subject matter advisors to generate innovative ideas that benefit both the students and Accenture. Her meticulous attention to detail has ensured the development of datasets that align with the program's objectives. This year's project, focused on building a Sentiment Analysis and Transcript Summary CoPilot for Call Center Agents using Generative AI, is a testament to her vision and expertise. 

#### Guiding Students to Success
Shawna provided functional and technical guidance, empowering students to develop an API service that can seamlessly integrate with call center systems. Her framework and mentorship enabled students to deliver outstanding results, showcasing the potential of AI in real-world applications.

#### Impact and Recognition
Shawna's dedication and perseverance have significantly enhanced our brand awareness and strengthened our relationship with the university. Her contributions have raised the bar for future engagements, and her tenacity has inspired our team to strive for excellence.

#### Well-Deserved Recognition
Shawna's exceptional leadership, technical expertise, and commitment to excellence make her an invaluable asset to our team. I am grateful for her contributions and look forward to her continued success in future endeavors." - Vish Chokshi (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Manager, Visual & Interaction Science)
